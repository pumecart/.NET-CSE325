# First Console Application Using Visual Code and C#

## Purpose of Application

This application was created to learn more about .NET Framework applications and to brush up on C#.  
This was a fun and simple application that also used code from the "C# Programming Yellow Book" by Rob Miles to further demonstrate
different commands in C#.
